## Hi there 👋

My name is Jobert - you pronounce like jo-bear (yes, a bear 🐻) - he/him/his

I'm an iOS engineer who loves to build things that can help our lives. I'm happy to be building for Apple platforms in this great community.

Please reach out if you have any questions about me or the work you see here. Or, just say hi, tell me about your greatest coding success this year or send me a pet photo!  

I can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jobertsa/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jobertsa/), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jobear), and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jobertsa). 😀

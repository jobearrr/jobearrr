## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Jobert here!
I've been working in software development since 2010, with a main focus on building intuitive, high-performance mobile applications for iOS using Swift. I also have a strong interest in application security and enjoy learning about and implementing best practices to keep users safe. Outside of work, I like to mentor other developers and regularly contribute to open source projects.

### What I'm Interested In

I'm interested in building software that cares about user privacy and is developed with strong ethical values. I think technology should help people without taking away their rights or freedom. That's why Iâ€™m always looking for open source projects that support privacy, ethics, and transparency.

If you know or maintain projects like this â€” especially open source â€” letâ€™s connect! Iâ€™d love to contribute.
